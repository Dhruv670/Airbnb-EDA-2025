🚨 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

 📊 Project Title: Analyzing Airbnb Data

I recently completed an exciting EDA project where I explored Airbnb listings data to uncover key business insights.

🔍 Key Highlights:

1. Analyzed pricing trends across different neighborhoods 

2. Identified top-performing locations based on average price & number of listings

3. Detected outliers and cleaned inconsistent data for accurate analysis.

Also, resolved issues occured due to Outlier Values.

The analysis provided a clearer view of how location, availability, and listing type impact pricing—valuable for both hosts and market analysts.
